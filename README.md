# FIN377-participation

My name is Julaisei Caguana-Salazar, and I am a senior at Lehigh Univeristy studying Finance. I am currently taking a class called FIN 377 Advanced Investments: Data Analytics, where I am learning to use python for the first time. My goal is to end the class being able to confidently put down python as one of my skills and spark an interest in learning other coding languages.

## In this repo you will find 5 folder and a navigation md file:

### 1. Codebook
 In this codebook folder you will find a My Cheat Sheet.ipynb file that contains some useful basic python coding functions and explainations. These really helped me get a grasp of the python coding language and hopefully helps you too.

### 2. Homework
This folder contains homework assignments at the end of some lectures. The topics that the homework covers are numpy pandas,visualization, and scraping practice problems. All these problems can be accessed in the lectures. You can access the lectures by going into my navigating_github.md file and clickin on the lecture url. 

### 3. Livecoding
This folder contains lecture materials such as code, notes, and comments. 

### 4. MISC
This folder contains several lecture .ipynb files and other scarping files.

### 5. Spyder
This folder contains a wiki_sp500_scraper.ipynb from L12 URLs for SP 500.ipynb found in the LiveCoding folder.

### 6. Navigating Github md file
This md file is very helpful in giving you the links needed to access lectures, homework, resources, and much more. I recommend openning this md file first and exploring the links on it before coding any folders.
